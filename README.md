1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/HugoC1000/School-Forum.git
    cd School-Forum/
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install PostgreSQL:**

### Codebase Structure

WolfKey uses a modular Django architecture:

- **Templates:** HTML files in `forum/templates/` define the UI and are rendered by views.
- **Views:** Python files in `forum/views/` handle HTTP requests, call services, and render templates.
- **Services:** Business logic is separated into `forum/services/` for maintainability. Views call these services to interact with models and perform actions.
- **Models:** Defined in `forum/models.py`, these represent the database structure.
- **Forms:** User input forms are defined in `forum/forms.py`.
- **Static:** CSS, JS, and images are in `static/`.
- **Management Commands:** Custom scripts are in `forum/management/commands/`.
- **Templatetags:** Custom template filters and tags are in `forum/templatetags/`.
- **API:** API endpoints are in `forum/api/`.
- **Tests:** Automated tests are in `forum/tests/`.

**Typical flow:**  
Templates → Views → Services → Models → Database

  - `settings.py`: Main configuration.
  - `urls.py`: URL routing.
- `forum/`: Main app.
  - `models.py`: Database models (User, Post, Solution, etc.).
  - `views/`: Handles web requests and responses.
  - `services/`: Contains business logic for posts, comments, profiles, etc.
  - `forms.py`: Django forms for user input.
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for all pages and components.
  - `static/`: CSS, JS, images.
  - `management/commands/`: Custom Django management commands.
  - `templatetags/`: Custom template filters and tags.
  - `api/`: API endpoints.

- `media/`: Uploaded files (profile pictures, etc.).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `README.md`: This documentation.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
2. Make your changes, following the code structure above.
3. Write clear commit messages.
4. Submit a pull request with a description of your changes.

**Tips for Beginners:**
- Start by reading the views and templates to understand the user flow.
- Use the services layer to add or modify business logic.
- For new features, add tests in the `forum/tests/` directory.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use:
```sh
python manage.py test
```

## Common Issues

- Sometimes `python3` is required instead of `python` (e.g., `python3 -m venv venv`).
- If libraries don't install correctly from `requirements.txt`, try installing them individually with `pip install <package>`.
